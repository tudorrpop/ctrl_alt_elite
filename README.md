## General Description & Features

This distributed application is concieved to offer a complete car parking management
solution across multiple stores of the same brand in a city. The application is designed to
serve both driving users and store administrators.
The first category of users are going to use a mobile solution where they will register and
login into an application and utilize a digital generated card to enter the parking space. The
mobile component will have an AI module integrated. This AI model will be capable of
offering responses to the usersâ€™s questions, related to both the store parking lots and their
availability and it will be capable of making predictions based on the history data. The
interactions will take part through a chat interface.
A web component will also be available for the store administrators. They will be able to see
the live state of the parking lots and several statistics regarding the traffic matters.
Each component will be hosted on a specific server in order to provide modularity.
